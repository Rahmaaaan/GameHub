# Game Hub

Game Hub is a comprehensive web application built using React and TypeScript, designed to provide gamers with an engaging platform to explore and discover various video games. This project incorporates essential aspects of modern web applications, including responsiveness, accessibility, and efficient state management. It consumes data from the RAWG API, one of the largest video game databases, to provide detailed information about games, including titles, thumbnails, screenshots, videos, and more.

## Features

- **Game Grid:** An organized display of video games in a grid layout for easy browsing. Each cell in the grid represents a game with its corresponding thumbnail.

- **Genre List:** Users can explore games based on their favorite genres, presented as a list of genres to choose from.

- **Platform Selector:** Filter games based on the gaming platform of choice using the Platform Selector.

- **Sort Selector:** Sort games based on various criteria such as popularity and release date using the Sort Selector.

- **Search Input:** A powerful search feature that allows users to find their favorite games directly.

- **Color Mode Switch:** Users can switch between dark mode and light mode based on their preference.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a mobile-first approach and is responsive to different screen sizes.
